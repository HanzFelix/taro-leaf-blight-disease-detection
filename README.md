# Taro Leaf Blight Disease Detection using Extreme Gradient Boosting

Detection of leaf blight disease from a dataset of cropped taro leaf images to distinguish between healthy and infected leaves. Detection is based on the extracted color and texture features using digital image processing techniques.

A dataset was created using the extracted features. The dataset was then used for training and testing the **XGBoost Classifier** model.
